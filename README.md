# Chess
Here's my first attempt at creating an actual program that isn't bubble-sort or anything school related. If you couldn't guess, the project at hand is chess. This project is being made in Java 11 using Swing.

### Description
This project is 50% fun, 25% trying to prove that I'm not awful at programming, and 25% "learning" (which is really pulling my hair out from getting NullPointerException over and over). I've decided to upload to GitHub to practice version control and share my programs with others (for whatever reason). My end goal is to have a chess program with a variety of settings, an easy-to-follow interface with a clean display to match, and generally just a program I can be proud of.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository or download the repository as a .zip file.
   * Extract the files to desired location if downloaded as a .zip file.
2. Run panels.Main in your IDE or some other method I'm not aware of.
3. Enjoy!

### Project Timeline
Project is currently a work in progress.

* 6/15/2020: First commit to GitHub. Program is an (overall) "working" version of chess.
